                In my final year's capstone project, we created a functinoal
                semi-autonomous self driving car prototype. We built it from
                scratch including the car and its chassis as well as the
                end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network model to turn RGB camera
                input to steering angle and speed. We also introduced an android
                app in the middle to convert any voice commands from user to
                override the default behavior (e.g. user can say 'turn left'
                which will be read by the system and the car will take left turn
                on next possible left turn).
            </p>
            <p>The model generalized well on unique track scenarios.</p>

                Below are some glimpses of our work (it was a long and tiring
                project so we were not able to document it upto the level we
                expected, but hope this gives a picture of the work we did).
                P.S. this is not a line-follower :D the car decides steering
                angle and speed based on RGB input (using neural network model).
                We also implemented red-light stop sign training.

            <h3>Detect fall using sensor data (coming from wearable device)</h3>
            <p>
                This repository implements a fall detection algorithm based on
                sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) to classify the
                movements of a person as either `fall` or `non-fall`. The
                implementation is done using

                `layers` API. The implementation uses a Convolutional Neural
                Network followed by several dense layers. The final output is a
                single sigmoid score (1 = fall, 0 = non-fall). A Mean squared
                error metric is used as the loss function and optimized using
                AdamOptimizer.

            <h3>A covid-19 simulation game</h3>
            <p>
                Covid-19 has taken over the world as we all know (27-06-2020).
                But even in times like these, we can try to take a different
                perspective on this and find out what might work to minimize the
                spread. While many are working towards building a vaccine which
                may ultimately fix this problem, I thought we all can experiment
                on what might work to minimize the spread. The main entity being
                blamed across the world is the government! So I thought we can
                all be the governments in this mini-game and modify our country
                policies to minimize the spread.
